In an Honour Mode story you would use it as follows...

**Scenario:** Save scum prior to stealing.

1. In Baulder's Gate 3 do a quicksave to create an autosave.
2. In my app click on **Backup Now**.
3. Back in BG3 conduct your shameful deeds; if you fail go back to Main Menu.
4. Once back in the Main Menu switch to my app and click on the **Load Autosave...** button.
5. By default the most recent autosave will be listed, but you can select an older one if desired.
6. Click on the **Load Autosave** button.
7. Back in BG3 click Continue.

It is that simple.
